#CabanaPIC

## Installation

This code has two major dependencies:

1. Kokkos
2. Cabana

Instructions on how to obtain and install both can be found [here](https://github.com/ECP-copa/Cabana/wiki/Build-Instructions)

Once these are installed, you can configure and build this project using CMake.
The only necessary configuration argument is the path to Cabana (which will
also bring in Kokkos). An example build line will look something like this:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/Cabana/build/install" ..
```

CabanaPIC uses the default enabled Kokkos backend (see more information
[here](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/wiki/Initialization#51-initialization-by-command-line-arguments)).
It is possible to require a CPU build by adding `-DREQUIRE_HOST=ON` (which uses
the default enabled host backend).

The default field solver is "EM"; to use the "ES" solver, add `-DSOLVER_TYPE="ES"`.


## Running

Users can compile in custom input decks by specifying `INPUT_DECK` at build
time, e.g:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/Cabana/build/install" -DINPUT_DECK=./decks/2stream-short.cxx ..
```

Some example decks live in `./decks`. Custom decks must follow the layout put
forth in `./src/input/decks.h`

## Feature Wishlist

1. Configurable to run in different precisions (real_t to configure float/double)
2. The particle data store layout should be configurable (AoS/SoA/AoSoA)
3. The particle shape function used should be configurable

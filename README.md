# Overview 

This document is to be used to collect a wish list of features before
development starts

## Installation

This code has two major dependencies:

1. Kokkos
2. Cabana

Instructions on how to obtain and install both can be found [here](https://github.com/ECP-copa/Cabana/wiki/Build-Instructions)

Once these are installed, you can configurable and build this project using
cmake. To do so, the user should manually tell CMake where to find Cabana, and
Cabana should bring Kokkos in for us. If that does not happen, the user should
specify the path to Kokkos on the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

An example build line will look something like this:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/tmp/Cabana/build/install" ..
```

For GPU builds, you additionally need to point the CXX compiler to the Kokkos
Cuda wrapper, you can do this by doing something like:


```
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/tmp/Cabana/build/install" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$KOKKOS_SRC_DIR/bin/nvcc_wrapper -DENABLE_GPU=ON ..
```

Remember: Kokkos and Cabana need to be build with GPU support

## Running

Users can compile in custom input decks by specifying `INPUT_DECK` at build
time, e.g:

```
CXX=g++-9 cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/tmp/Cabana/build/install" -DINPUT_DECK=./decks/2stream-short.cxx ..
```

Some example decks live in `./decks`. Custom decks must follow the layout put
forth in `./src/input/decks.h`

## Feature Wishlist

1. Configurable to run in different precisions (real_t to configure float/double)
2. The particle data store layout should be Configurable (AoS/SoA/AoSoA)
3. The particle shape function used should be configurable
